                I created this site as part of my summer project at Iolani.

                        This week, I added a few games to my site. I also added a fancybox to my site and a games
                        sub-page. I also added animations for my site on load.

                        This week we worked in Adobe XD. I began my final project, the Custom UI Design, and worked on
                        my final coded site.

                    <p>
                        I used Photoshop and Illustrator to make and edit images for my site, which I then used as SVGs
                        on my site. I also used Adobe XD to create my own prototype-able website and prototyped it, and
                        edited the UI to create an asthetically-pleasing website.

                        I began adding essential CSS and HTML to my website. I also added a footer, header, nav, and two
                        more sub-pages. By the end, I had three working sub-pages: a blog page, for summaries of what I
                        learned and did, and an about page for resources and helpful sites. I also customized my site
                        with CSS.

                        I created a GitHub repository, and began my site. I started with adding the HTML, and later
                        began adding the CSS for styling. I worked on my index.html or home page to add content for
                        <a href="https://iwebstudent22.github.io">"Summer 2019."</a>
